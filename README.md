# Topas_wrapper

This project was developed by National Cancer Centre Singapore for use in determining imaging dose to the patient during treatment set up. 

The project requires both TOPAS MC and Geant 4. This python script is a wrapper that creates a graphical user interface that allows end point users to easily input a CT DICOM image set and the imaging parameters to determine the estimated imaging dose recieved by patients on top of their treatment dose.
